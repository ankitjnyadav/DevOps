How to copy your files to Webserver

Manually
$ docker cp Google.css devops_webserver:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
$ docker cp index.html devops_webserver:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/

Mount/Link the workspace to the webserver (changes automatically gets reflected)
$ docker run -dit --name devops_webserver2 -v /home/ay/PycharmProjects/DevOps:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd

-----------------------------------
Port Address Translation (PAT), is an extension to network address translation (NAT) that permits multiple devices
on a local area network (LAN) to be mapped to a single public IP address. The goal of PAT is to conserve IP addresses.

Most home networks use PAT. In such a scenario, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns a single IP address to the home network's router.
When Computer X logs on the Internet, the router assigns the client a port number, which is appended to the internal IP address.
This, in effect, gives Computer X a unique address. If Computer Z logs on the Internet at the same time, the router assigns it the same local IP address with a different port number.
Although both computers are sharing the same public IP address and accessing the Internet at the same time, the router knows exactly which computer to send specific packets to because each computer has a unique internal address.

PAT
$ docker run -dit --name devops_webserver2 -p 8081:80 -v /home/ay/PycharmProjects/DevOps:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd

Jenkins integration

Job1:
sudo cp -v -r -f * /home/ay/Documents/Jenkins/lwweb

Job2:
sudo docker run -dit -p 8082:80 -v /home/ay/Documents/Jenkins/lwweb:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ --name jenkins_wbs httpd

Write condition:
if sudo docker ps | grep jenkins_wbs
then
echo "Already Running!"
else
sudo docker run -dit -p 8082:80 -v /home/ay/Documents/Jenkins/lwweb:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ --name jenkins_wbs httpd
fi

Chaining
Job chaining in Jenkins is the process of automatically starting other job(s) after the execution of a job.

Enabling Network connectivity
--------------------------------------------
Config/Service File : (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service)

Add->
ExecStart= -H tcp://0.0.0.0:4243

From Client Machine
DOCKER_HOST=DOCKER_HOST_IP_ADDRESS:4243
export DOCKER_HOST=DOCKER_HOST_IP_ADDRESS:4243
export DOCKER_HOST=192.168.31.137:4243
echo $DOCKER_HOST
Now, run
docker ps
