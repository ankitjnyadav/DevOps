Jenkins is built on Java
Hence Jenkins wont run untils JDK/JRE is not present on the system.

Java has several versions
Install OpenJDK

Steps to install Jenkins
sudo wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

To start any server or program we can use systemctl start jenkins

Continuous Integration

Dev Env --> Continuous Development --> GitHub --> Continuous Deployment --> Released product

Every task you want jenkins to perform, we need to create a Job (Jenkins).

> The First screen after login is known as Dashboard or Jenkins portal.
> Job is also known as item.


Every project/job will have their own workspace.

Pipeline -->
> Go to Github
> Download the code
> Copy the code to var/www/html

For Rehat/CentOs:
setfacl -m u:jenkins:rwx /var/www/html/

For Ubuntu:
cd /var
sudo chown -R jenkins:root www/

Build Triggers
--------------
1. Build periodically
Syntax is like crontab. [https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm]

5 Things
Minute Hours Date Month Day(of the week)
 0-59  0-23  1-31 Month M-S

For eg 5th June, 10:05AM
5 10 5 6 *

5 * * * *
at 5mins
at 1hr 5min
at 2hr 5mins

run on every hour


2. Poll SCM
"Poll SCM" polls the SCM periodically for checking if any changes/ new commits were made
and shall build the project if any new commits were pushed since the last build,
whereas the "build" shall build the project periodically irrespective to whether or not any changes were made.
