OpenShift is a Container Platform
---------------------------------
Wiki-
OpenShift is a family of containerization software developed by Red Hat.
Its flagship product is the OpenShift Container Platformâ€”an on-premises platform
as a service built around Docker containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes
on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The family's other products provide
this platform through different environments: OKD serves as the community-driven
upstream (akin to Fedora), OpenShift Online is the platform offered as software
as a service, and Openshift Dedicated is the platform offered as a managed service.

The Openshift UI has various functionalities, allowing one to monitor the container
resources, container health, the nodes the containers reside on, IP addresses of the
nodes, etc. The key store can be accessed via the Secrets in Openshift. The OC CLI
command line tool also offers similar functionalities.
